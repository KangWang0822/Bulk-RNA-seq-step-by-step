# Bulk-RNA-seq-step-by-step

Guided by https://scilifelab.github.io/courses/ngsintro/1805/labs/rnaseq_161129.

1.check the quality of the raw reads with FastQC.
2.map the reads to the reference genome using Star.
3.convert between SAM and BAM files format using Samtools.
4.assess the post-alignment reads quality using QualiMap.
5.count the reads overlapping with genes regions using featureCounts.
6.build statistical model to find DE genes using edgeR from a prepared R script.
