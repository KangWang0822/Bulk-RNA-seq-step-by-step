# Bulk-RNA-seq-step-by-step

Guided by https://scilifelab.github.io/courses/ngsintro/1805/labs/rnaseq_161129.

check the quality of the raw reads with FastQC
map the reads to the reference genome using Star
convert between SAM and BAM files format using Samtools
assess the post-alignment reads quality using QualiMap
count the reads overlapping with genes regions using featureCounts
build statistical model to find DE genes using edgeR from a prepared R script
